Script to summarise and visualise multiple [Mutation Annotation Format](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/MutationAnnotationFormat) (MAF) files using *[maftools](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/maftools/inst/doc/maftools.html)* R package.

Make sure to set the java max heap size to 2Gb to accomodate big gene tables written into excel spreadsheet using the xlsx R package


```r
##### Set the jave max heap size to 2Gb to accomodate big gene tables
options( java.parameters = "-Xmx2000m" )
```

### Load libraries


```r
suppressMessages(library(knitr))
suppressMessages(library(maftools))
suppressMessages(library(xlsx))
suppressMessages(library(optparse))
suppressMessages(library(DT))
```

## Read MAF files

Go to the MAF files directory, read the files and create directory for output files, if does not exist already


```r
##### Read MAF files and put associated info into a list
mafFiles <- params$mafFiles
mafInfo <- vector("list", length(mafFiles))

cohorts.list <- params$cohorts
names(mafInfo) <- cohorts.list

for ( i in 1:length(mafFiles) ) {
  mafInfo[[i]] = read.maf(maf = mafFiles[i], verbose = FALSE)
}
```

```
## [1] NA
## [1] NA
## [1] NA
## [1] NA
```

```r
##### Create directory for output files
outDir <- paste(params$mafDir, params$outDir, sep = "/")

if ( !file.exists(params$outDir) ){
  dir.create(outDir)
}
```

## MAF files summary - tables {.tabset}

### Overall summary

Generate tables  with basic information about each MAF file, including NCBI build, no. fo samples and genes, no. of different mutation types ( frameshift deletions, frameshift insertions, in-frame deletions, in-frame insertions, missense mutations, nonsense mutations, nonstop mutations, splice site mutations, translation start site mutations), as well as the total no. of mutations present in the MAF file. Individual tables present summary for corresponding datasets.


```r
##### Write overall summary into a file
if ( !file.exists(paste(outDir, "MAF_summary.xlsx", sep = "/")) ){
  for ( i in 1:length(mafFiles) ) {
    write.xlsx(mafInfo[[i]]@summary, file=paste(outDir, "MAF_summary.xlsx", sep="/"), sheetName=cohorts.list[i], row.names=FALSE,  append=TRUE)
  }
}

##### Present a MAF file summary table in the html report
##### Create a list for htmlwidgets
widges.list <- htmltools::tagList()

for ( i in 1:length(mafFiles) ) {
  widges.list[[i]] <- DT::datatable(data = mafInfo[[i]]@summary, caption = paste0("MAF summary: ", cohorts.list[i]))
}

##### Print a list of htmlwidgets
widges.list
```

Additionally ceate an excel spreadsheet listing all fields (columns) in the individaul MAF files.


```r
##### Get all fields in MAF files
if ( !file.exists(paste(outDir, "MAF_fields.xlsx", sep = "/")) ){
  for ( i in 1:length(mafFiles) ) {
    write.xlsx(maftools::getFields(mafInfo[[i]]), file=paste(outDir, "MAF_fields.xlsx", sep="/"), sheetName=cohorts.list[i], row.names=FALSE,  append=TRUE, col.names=FALSE)
  }
}
```

### Samples summary

Create tables with samples summary. Each table contains per-sample information (rows) about no. of different types of mutations (columns), including frameshift deletions, frameshift insertions, in-frame deletions, in-frame insertions, missense mutations, nonsense mutations, nonstop mutations, splice site mutations, translation start site mutations, as well as the total no. of mutations present in the MAF file.


```r
##### Write samples summary into a file
if ( !file.exists(paste(outDir, "MAF_sample_summary.xlsx", sep = "/")) ) {

  for ( i in 1:length(mafFiles) ) {
    write.xlsx(maftools::getSampleSummary(mafInfo[[i]]), file=paste(outDir, "MAF_sample_summary.xlsx", sep="/"), sheetName=cohorts.list[i], row.names=FALSE,  append=TRUE)
  }
}

##### Present a sample table in the html report
##### Create a list for htmlwidgets
widges.list <- htmltools::tagList()

for ( i in 1:length(mafFiles) ) {
  widges.list[[i]] <- DT::datatable(data = maftools::getSampleSummary(mafInfo[[i]]), caption = paste0("Samples summary: ", cohorts.list[i]), filter = "top")
}

##### Print a list of htmlwidgets
widges.list

### Genes summary

Now present gene summary info. This part creates tables for individual cohorts with per-gene information (rows) about no. of different types of mutations (columns), including frameshift deletions, frameshift insertions, in-frame deletions, in-frame insertions, missense mutations, nonsense mutations, nonstop mutations, splice site mutations, translation start site mutations, as well as the total no. of mutations present in the MAF file. The last two columns contain the no. of samples with mutations/alterations in the corresponding gene.


```r
##### Write gene summary into a file
if ( !file.exists(paste(outDir, "MAF_gene_summary.xlsx", sep = "/")) ){
  for ( i in 1:length(mafFiles) ) {
    write.xlsx(maftools::getGeneSummary(mafInfo[[i]]), file=paste(outDir, "MAF_gene_summary.xlsx", sep="/"), sheetName=cohorts.list[i], row.names=FALSE,  append=TRUE)
  }
}

##### Present a gene table in the html report
##### Create a list for htmlwidgets
widges.list <- htmltools::tagList()

for ( i in 1:length(mafFiles) ) {
  widges.list[[i]] <- DT::datatable(data = maftools::getGeneSummary(mafInfo[[i]]), caption = paste0("Genes summary: ", cohorts.list[i]), filter = "top")
}

##### Print a list of htmlwidgets
widges.list
```

## MAF files summary  - heatmaps {.tabset .tabset-fade}

### Samples summary

Generate an interactive heatmap to facilitate outlier samples detection. Rows and columns represent samples and mutation types, respectively. The colour scale from blue to yellow indicates low and high number of various mutations types, respectively, reported for corresponding samples. Samples are ordered by the number of mutations to facilitate identification of individuals with extreme mutation burden.


```r
suppressMessages(library(plotly))
suppressMessages(library(heatmaply))

##### Create a list for htmlwidgets
widges.list <- htmltools::tagList()

##### Display samples summary in a form of interactive heatmap
for ( i in 1:length(mafFiles) ) {

  sampleSummary <- data.frame(maftools::getSampleSummary(mafInfo[[i]]))
  rownames(sampleSummary) <-sampleSummary[,"Tumor_Sample_Barcode"]
  sampleSummary <- subset(sampleSummary, select=-c(Tumor_Sample_Barcode, total))

  ##### Generate interactive heatmap
  p <- heatmaply(sampleSummary, main = paste0("Samples summary: ", cohorts.list[i]), Rowv=NULL, Colv=NULL, scale="none", dendrogram="none", trace="none", hide_colorbar = FALSE, fontsize_row = 8, label_names=c("Sample","Mutation_type","Count")) %>%

  ##### Add plot to the list for htmlwidgets
  widges.list[[i]] <- as_widget(ggplotly(p))

   ##### Save the heatmap as html (PLOTLY)
  htmlwidgets::saveWidget(as_widget(p), paste0(outDir, "/MAF_sample_summary_heatmap_", cohorts.list[i], ".html"), selfcontained = TRUE)

### Genes summary

This time generate an interactive heatmap to summmarise genes information. Rows and columns represent genes and mutation types, respectively. The colour scale from blue to yellow indicates low and high number of various mutations types, respectively, observed in corresponding genes. Genes are ordered by the number of reported mutations. The total number of mutations in individual genes, as well as the number of samples with mutations are also presented in the last three columns. Note, for transparency we show only the top 50 mutated genes.

## Visualisation {.tabset .tabset-fade}

This part creates a set of plots summarising individual MAF files.

### MAF summary

A summary for MAF file displaying frequency of various mutation/SNV types/classes (top panel), the number of variants in each sample as a stacked bar-plot (bottom-left) and variant types as a box-plot (bottom-middle), as well as the frequency of different mutation types for the top 10 mutated genes (bottom-right). The horizontal dashed line in stacked bar-plot represents median number of variants across the cohort.


```r
###### Generate separate plot for each cohort
for ( i in 1:length(mafFiles) ) {

  cat(paste(cohorts.list[i], "cohort\n\n", sep=" "))
  ##### Plotting MAF summary
  par(mar=c(4,4,2,0.5), oma=c(1.5,2,2,1))
  maftools::plotmafSummary(maf = mafInfo[[i]], rmOutlier = TRUE, addStat = 'median', dashboard = TRUE, titvRaw = FALSE)
  mtext("MAF summary", outer=TRUE,  cex=1, line=-0.5)
}
```

### Oncoplots

Oncoplot illustrating different types of mutations observed across samples for the 10 most frequently mutated genes. The side and top bar-plots present the frequency of mutations in each gene and in each sample, respectively.


```r
###### Generate separate plot for each cohort
for ( i in 1:length(mafFiles) ) {

  cat(paste(cohorts.list[i], "cohort\n\n", sep=" "))

  ##### Drawing oncoplots for the top 10 genes in each cohort
  plot.new()

### Transition and transversions

Plots presenting the transition and transversions distribution. The box-plots (top panel) show the overall distribution of the six different conversions (C>A, C>G, C>T, T>C, T>A and T>G)(left), and the transition and transversions frequency (right). The stacked bar-plot (bottom) displays the fraction of the six different conversions in each sample.


```r
###### Generate separate plot for each cohort
for ( i in 1:length(mafFiles) ) {

  cat(paste(cohorts.list[i], "cohort\n\n", sep=" "))

  ##### Drawing distribution plots of the transitions and transversions

```

### Pair-wise comparisons

Perform *Fisher Exact* test on all genes for all possible pair-wise comprisons to find differentially mutated genes between queried cohorts and to aid identification of global differences in mutation patterns in corresponding *MAFs*. The results are presented in form of a heatmap with rows and columns representing genes and cohorts, respectively, and heatmap colours indicating the adjusted *Fisher Exact* test p-values. The colour key is on the left-hand side. Low p-values (yellow) indicate differentially mutated genes between the corresponding cohorts. Genes are clustered to facilite the indetification possible differences between individaul cohorts.

### Comparison with TCGA cohorts

Plot illustrating the mutation load in ICGC PACA-CA cohort along distribution of variants compiled from over 10,000 WXS samples across 33 TCGA landmark cohorts. Every dot represents a sample whereas the red horizontal lines are the median numbers of mutations in the respective cancer types. The vertical axis (log scaled) shows the number of mutations per megabase whereas the different cancer types are ordered on the horizontal axis based on their median numbers of somatic mutations. This plot is similar to the one described in the paper "Signatures of mutational processes in human cancer" by Alexandrov et al. (PMID: 23945592)


```r
###### Generate separate plot for each cohort

  ##### Compare mutation load against TCGA cohorts
  maftools::tcgaCompare(maf = mafInfo[[i]], cohortName = cohorts.list[i], primarySite=TRUE)
